    "### Step 0: Introduction to the Naive Bayes Theorem ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes theorem is one of the earliest probabilistic inference algorithms developed by Reverend Bayes (which he used to try and infer the existence of God no less) and still performs extremely well for certain use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's best to understand this theorem using an example. Let's say you are a member of the Secret Service and you have been deployed to protect the Democratic presidential nominee during one of his/her campaign speeches. Being a public event that is open to all, your job is not easy and you have to be on the constant lookout for threats. So one place to start is to put a certain threat-factor for each person. So based on the features of an individual, like the age, sex, and other smaller factors like is the person carrying a bag?, does the person look nervous? etc. you can make a judgement call as to if that person is viable threat. \n",
    "\n",
    "If an individual ticks all the boxes up to a level where it crosses a threshold of doubt in your mind, you can take action and remove that person from the vicinity. The Bayes theorem works in the same way as we are computing the probability of an event(a person being a threat) based on the probabilities of certain related events(age, sex, presence of bag or not, nervousness etc. of the person). \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to consider is the independence of these features amongst each other. For example if a child looks nervous at the event then the likelihood of that person being a threat is not as much as say if it was a grown man who was nervous. To break this down a bit further, here there are two features we are considering, age AND nervousness. Say we look at these features individually, we could design a model that flags ALL persons that are nervous as potential threats. However, it is likely that we will have a lot of false positives as there is a strong chance that minors present at the event will be nervous. Hence by considering the age of a person along with the 'nervousness' feature we would definitely get a more accurate result as to who are potential threats and who aren't. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the 'Naive' bit of the theorem where it considers each feature to be independent of each other which may not always be the case and hence that can affect the final judgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the Bayes theorem calculates the probability of a certain event happening(in our case, a message being  spam) based on the joint probabilistic distributions of certain other events(in our case, the appearance of certain words in a message). We will dive into the workings of the Bayes theorem later in the mission, but first, let us understand the data we are going to work with."

    "sklearn has several Naive Bayes implementations that we can use and so we do not have to do the math from scratch. We will be using sklearns `sklearn.naive_bayes` method to make predictions on our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will be using the multinomial Naive Bayes implementation. This particular classifier is suitable for classification with discrete features (such as in our case, word counts for text classification). It takes in integer word counts as its input. On the other hand Gaussian Naive Bayes is better suited for continuous data as it assumes that the input data has a Gaussian(normal) distribution."

    "\n",
    "One of the major advantages that Naive Bayes has over other classification algorithms is its ability to handle an extremely large number of features. In our case, each word is treated as a feature and there are thousands of different words. Also, it performs well even with the presence of irrelevant features and is relatively unaffected by them. The other major advantage it has is its relative simplicity. Naive Bayes' works well right out of the box and tuning it's parameters is rarely ever necessary, except usually in cases where the distribution of the data is known. \n",
    "It rarely ever overfits the data. Another important advantage is that its model training and prediction times are very fast for the amount of data it can handle."
